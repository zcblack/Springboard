README:

This github repository is a data analytics and machine learning project completed as the second capstone project of the Springboard Data Science Career Track.
The analysis was performed on data from Breckenridge Grand Vacations (BGV) in an attempt to understand and predict the Volume per Guest of a prospect during a fractional ownership sales tour.

All data is privately held by BGV and is therefore not shared in this repository.
