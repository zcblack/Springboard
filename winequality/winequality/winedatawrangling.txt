The wine quality data came in two csv files from  P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis’ analysis: Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. Both the red  and white data frames contained no missing values. There were 11 observed physicochemical properties represented by floats and a discrete categorical variable quality that uses a 1-10 scale. In the data wrangling process, I first removed the outliers that were outside two standard deviations for each of the 11 observed properties.  After removing these outliers the white dataframe had 2,935 observation and the red dataframe had 1,012 observations. After removing the outliers, I grouped the discrete categorical variable quality into three values: poor (values 1-4), good (values 5,6), and excellent(values 7-10). Below I have included the info for both dataframes:
